# Express.js Route Handler with Insufficient Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a route that lacks proper checks for invalid input and error propagation. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashing the server or exposing sensitive information to users. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code attempts to fetch user data based on an ID passed in the request. However, it fails to:

* Validate the user ID (e.g., ensure it's a number and exists).
* Properly handle database errors.
* Return informative error messages to the client.

These omissions lead to a poor user experience and potential security risks.

## Solution

The improved code addresses these issues by:

* Adding input validation to ensure the user ID is valid.
* Implementing comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage database errors and other exceptions.
* Returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
